Infogram lets you quickly and easily create interactive and responsive data visualizations

== Description ==

Make beautiful animated charts, graphs and reports online - no coding skills required.

Infogram is a data visualization tool that helps you create interactive charts, infographics and maps. It is used by marketing teams, newsrooms, bloggers and students all over the world.
Our charts and infographics are fully responsive by default which means they automatically adapt and are optimized to mobile devices of any screen size.

We offer a wide range of high-quality template designs and visually-balanced pre-set colors, making data visualization fast and easy, so you can focus on the data while we handle the design.

The Infogram WordPress plugin:

*   Allows users to authenticate into their own library and access their content directly from the WordPress visual editor
*   Supports one-click embedding from the library
*   Supports embedding of any publicly available chart or infographic made with Infogram through the URL
*   Fosters team collaboration by allowing multiple users to post to WordPress with the automatically generated shortcode or the URL
